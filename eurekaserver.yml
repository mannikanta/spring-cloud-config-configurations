                           # of other microservices, the eureka server never going to call microservices, thats why it is unnessary to fetch all the registry details of microservices

                           # their detaisl or to discover other service details.
                           # http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/ this will be replaced as http://localhose:8070/eureka (just read the elements in this yml file)
